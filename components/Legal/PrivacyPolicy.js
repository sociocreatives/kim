                        Although users can submit credit card or other payment card information to pay for a service through the Mr.KIM Platform, Mr.KIM does not receive this information itself.

Stripe then communicates to Mr.KIM whether your payment has cleared but does not provide payment card information to Mr.KIM.

In some cases, we may link the information you provide in the survey with Personal Information in your Mr.KIM account, such as your name or email address.

                    </p>

                     <h5 className='title-main'>Information We Collect Through Technology </h5>
                    <p className='textlight'>
                        We collect information through technology to enhance our ability to serve you. When you access and use the Mr.KIM Platform, or contact Mr.KIM or its third-party service providers, Mr.KIM and, in some cases, our third-party service providers collect information about you or how you interact with the Mr.KIM Platform. We describe below a few of the methods we use to collect information through technology.
                    </p>

                    <p className='textlight'>
                        When you visit the Mr.KIM Platform, we collect your Internet Protocol (IP) address. An IP address is often associated with the portal you used to enter the Internet, like your Internet service provider (ISP), company, association, or university. While an IP address may reveal your ISP or geographic area, we cannot determine your identity solely based upon your IP address. However, we may link the last IP address you used to access the Mr.KIM Platform to Personal Information you provide us. Where, according to local law, IP addresses and the like are considered Personal Information, we treat them as such.
                    </p>

                     <p className='textlight'>
                        We may also collect a unique identifier for your computer, mobile device, or other device used to access the Mr.KIM Platform ("Device Identifier"). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to the device you used to access the Mr.KIM Platform. We may link the Device Identifier to other information about your visit, such as what pages you viewed, and to Personal Information you provide us, such as your name. In addition to these methods, we may also collect information about how you interact with the Mr.KIM Platform through advertising partners and data enrichment tools.
                    </p>

                    <h5 className='title-main'>Do We Use Cookies? </h5>
                    <p className='textlight'>
                        Yes. For more information about cookies, please visit our Cookies Policy ( hyperlink the cookie policy site).
                    </p>

                     <h5 className='title-main'>Web Beacons</h5>
                    <p className='textlight'>
                        We may include small graphic images or other web programming code, called web beacons (also known as "pixel tags", "web bugs" or "clear GIFs"), in our web and mobile pages and messages. The web beacons are minute graphics with a unique identifier. They are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored in a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Web beacons help us better manage content on the Mr.KIM Platform by informing us what content is effective, monitoring how users navigate the Mr.KIM Platform, counting users of the Mr.KIM Platform, and counting how many e-mails sent by us were actually opened.
                    </p>

                     <h5 className='title-main'>Your 'Do Not Track' Browser Setting</h5>

                        We do not support the Do Not Track (DNT) browser setting. DNT is a preference you can set in your browser's settings to let the websites you visit know that you do not want the websites collecting your Personal Information.
                    </p>
                     <p className='textlight'>
                        We do track your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. For example, we use web beacons to help us determine what links or advertisers brought you to our Site. We also use third-party service providers to display advertisements to you on other websites based on your activities while on the Mr.KIM Platform.
